## Summary

### Drawback

This interface provide a single analysis with a case by case display. It may not use easier or fast to analyze the trend on this dataset with the actual interface.

### Suggestion

- 1: Add a stastical box over the table to get a first impression.
- 2: some keywords in the comments section may give the another insights that could not have been records by the data.
